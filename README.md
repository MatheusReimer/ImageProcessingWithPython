# ImageProcessingWithPython ##

<p>This is a repo containing a few implementations with python and opencv</p></br>

<p>It's important to note that in the opencv library, the colors are set as 'BGR' instead of 'RGB'</p></br>

<p>For more information regarding the use of opencv with python - especially on google collab - here is the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/xn2333/OpenCV/blob/master/Image_Processing_in_Python_Final.ipynb#scrollTo=Tz7UAjxjfMuz">doc</a> to it </p>
</br>
<p> The main idea behind this project is to understand how the pixels manipulations work instead of using a ready to use function. Hence the fact that i used a lot of iterations to do it is justified.</p>

<p>Please, note that the code is very raw for a better understanding of how it works. This is by far not the best implementation in terms of perfomance.</p>
